## Development

For all developers, take a look at our [Wiki](https://github.com/HackRU/sledge/wiki).

Sledge is currently being completely rewritten from scratch, so development is happening rapidly and changes are constantly being made to the codebase. And if you are new, welcome! We have a great team and a wealth of information for you. To get started, take a look at the [First Time Setup](https://github.com/HackRU/sledge/wiki/Setup) page on our Wiki.
