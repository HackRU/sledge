# Roadmap

This document represents the goals and plans of Sledge.

## Spring 2019

A few things we're focusing on

 - Better algorithms for choosing winner
 - Better security and stability
 - Performance improvements
 - A page for sponsors
 - Split admin stuff into multiple pages

As before, we'll need a deployment plan and a backup plan although these can be
mostly copied from last year. I also want to have `v1.0.0` by June and with that
have at least one person understand it enough where I can take less
responsibility for future changes.
